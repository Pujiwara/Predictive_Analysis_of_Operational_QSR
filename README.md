Description:
Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) require a deeper understanding of which operational factors most strongly influence customer satisfaction, as well as how operational changes can impact overall business performance.
The simulation shows that improvements in product quality and staff efficiency have a greater impact on customer satisfaction than simply accelerating the service process.

Tools Used:
1. PostgreSQL: data storage, cleaning, and modeling
2. Python: NLP-based sentiment analysis. Pandas, SQLAlchemy, NLTK (stopwords)
3. Power BI: data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard visualization

Key Insights:
1. Item rating and staff efficiency are the most influential factors affecting customer satisfaction.
2. Wait time has a negative impact, but its effect is smaller compared to service quality and product quality.
3. The predictive model demonstrates high accuracy with a low average error.

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/john8909/qsr-operational-dataset

Analytical Approach:
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand temporal patterns, menu performance, staff dynamics, and queue behavior
- Operationally driven feature engineering
- Predictive modeling using linear regression
- Model validation and error analysis
- What-if scenario simulation to support decision-making

Power BI Dashboard Structure:
The dashboard is organized into two main pages:
1. Executive Overview
2. Actual vs Predicted Performance
3. Key Operational Driver
4. What-If Scenario Simulation
5. Operational Insight
